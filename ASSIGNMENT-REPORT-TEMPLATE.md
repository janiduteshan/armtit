## Project Overview

[Provide a brief overview of your AR classroom application, explaining its purpose and main features. Describe how users interact with it and what they can expect to see.]

## Development Process

### Technology Stack
- **Platform:** Web-based AR
- **Frameworks/Libraries:**
  - A-Frame
  - AR.js
  - [Other libraries used]
- **Development Tools:**
  - [List development tools, editors, etc.]

### Implementation Process

[Describe the steps your group took to implement the application. Include the planning phase, division of tasks, development challenges, and how you overcame them. This should be a chronological account of your development journey.]

### 3D Models

[Describe the 3D models used in your application. Explain where you obtained them from (if not created by your team), any modifications made, and why you chose these specific models.]

### AR Markers

[Explain the design process for your markers. Why did you choose specific images? How did you ensure they worked reliably? Include information about marker generation and testing.]

## Creative Elements

[Detail the creative components added to make the application more engaging. This could include:]

### Animations

[Describe any animations implemented in your application, such as rotating objects, movement, etc.]

### Sound Effects

[Detail the sound effects incorporated into your application. Explain how they enhance the user experience and where they were sourced from.]

### Particle Effects

[If applicable, describe any particle effects added to your application and how they improve the visual appeal or user engagement.]

### User Interface

[Discuss any UI elements that improve usability or provide additional information to users.]

## Screenshots and Demonstrations

[Include at least 3-5 screenshots showing different aspects of your application in action. Each screenshot should have a caption explaining what is being shown.]

### Screenshot 1: [Caption]
